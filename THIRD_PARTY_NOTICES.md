The AIME evaluation prompt/task configurations are adapted from
[lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness),
distributed under the MIT License; see
[licenses/lm-evaluation-harness.txt](licenses/lm-evaluation-harness.txt).
The HMMT prompt configuration comes from the research evaluation setup.
The new evaluation adapters use the public math-verification and LiveCodeBench
APIs; no vendored LiveCodeBench or Pebble implementation is included.

## Changes in this distribution

The release adds cached anchor-pair scoring, cross-tokenizer candidate projection,
aligned multi-anchor target composition, tilted-target training, portable
launchers, and math/code evaluation adapters. Experiment-specific scheduling,
internal paths, run logs, and checkpoint artifacts are not distributed.

The numerical scoring, composition, and loss kernels are carried over from the
research implementation. Public-facing entrypoints and packaging have been
rewritten. The `offline_direct_opd` names remain in low-level modules to preserve
the serialized dataset format and configuration interfaces.

## External dependencies and data

PyTorch, Megatron-LM, mbridge, Megatron-Bridge, SGLang, vLLM, lm-evaluation-harness,
LiveCodeBench, and other dependencies are installed separately and retain their
own licenses. Model weights, training datasets, and benchmark data are not
included. Downloading and using each artifact remains subject to its own license
and access conditions.
